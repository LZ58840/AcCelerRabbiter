# AcCelerRabbiter (ACR)
Proof of concept of a quick SIFT-based image similarity indexer using Python Celery, RabbitMQ, and MySQL database storage. This is based on the previous project [SIFT-Image-Indexer](https://github.com/LZ58840/SIFT-Image-Indexer) and constructs a benchmark that consists of a ACR worker and ACR client.

Code is written as an extension of AnimewallpaperBot and is expected to be officially implemented by June 2023.
